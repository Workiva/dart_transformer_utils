## Development

This project leverages [the dart_dev package](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/dart_dev)
for most of its tooling needs, including static analysis, code formatting,
running tests, collecting coverage, and serving examples. Check out
[the dart_dev readme](https://github.com/Workiva/dart_dev) for more information.
